# BRS-EMU: BrightScript 2D API Emulator

An emulator for the Roku BrightScript language that runs on Chromium based browsers and Electron applications.

[![NPM Version](https://badge.fury.io/js/brs-emu.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/brs-emu)

## The Library

This library extends [**brs**](https://github.com/sjbarag/brs), a _command line interpreter_ for **BrightScript** language, by implementing the **Draw 2D API** components (`roScreen`, `roCompositor`, `roRegion`, etc.) and several other **BrightScript** components allowing a full channel execution over an **HTML5 Canvas**, including emulation of the Roku remote control. 

**Note:** Although **brs-emu** runs channels with user interface, it has no intention of emulating the full **Roku OS** user interface, see [Current Limitations](docs/limitations.md) page for full details on what is out of scope.

## Technology and Compatibility

This emulator is bundled as a couple of **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)** Javascript libraries: 
- `brsEmu.js` the **[emulator API](docs/emulator-api.md)** 
- `brsEmu.worker.js` that runs as a **[Web Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers)**

It uses features like [SharedArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer) and [OffScreenCanvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OffscreenCanvas), that are _bleeding edge_ in the browser engines implementation, because of that, at this moment, it can only be executed in [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home) based browsers, like [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Brave](https://brave.com/download/), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/), [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) or embedded on an [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) application. The **BrightScript 2D API Emulator** is a full client-side library, nothing is sent or processed in the server side.

## Desktop Application

You can also run the emulator as a multi-platform **desktop application** (Windows, Linux & macOS) that uses the same library generated by this project, download and install the specific OS package from the [latest release](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-emu/releases). For the app source and documentation check the [app repository](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-emu-app). The desktop app, introduces several aditional features, such as the **ECP** (External Control Protocol) and **Remote Console** servers to allow integration with 3rd party development tools like the [VSCode BrightScript Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=celsoaf.brightscript). It also allows you to control the device configuration like screen resolution, localization, among others.

 ## How to use it

If you just want to try the emulator, not installing or downloading anything, then simply try the demo website at: https://lvcabral.com/brs

### Installation
The **brs-emu** project is published as a `node` package, so use `npm`:

```shell
$ npm install brs-emu
```

or `yarn` if that's your preference:

```shell
$ yarn add brs-emu
```

### Note for BrightScript Developers

You can see the debug messages from `print` statements in your code using the _browser or desktop app console_, just make sure you open the _Developer Tools (Ctrl+Shift+i)_ before loading your channel package or brs file. Exceptions from the emulator will be shown there too. If your code does show an error in some scenario not listed on the [limitations documentation](docs/limitations.md), feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/lvcabral/brs-emu/issues).


## Games and Demos

You can try the emulator by running one of the demonstration channels included in the repository, these are pre-configured as _clickable icons_ on `index.html`. In addition to those, you can load your own code, either as a single **.brs** file or a channel **.zip package**. Below there is a list of tested games that are publicly available with source code, download the `zip` files and have fun!
